This guide explains how to **Void a Payment**, which allows you to void a previously authorized payment before it has been captured. Voiding a payment cancels the transaction and prevents it from being processed.

## Prerequisites

Before calling the void payment endpoint, ensure the following:

- The payment you want to void has been authorized but not yet captured.
- You have the unique payment identifier of the transaction to void.

## Void a Payment

To void a payment, you will use the [Void a Payment](/reference/links/void-payment) endpoint, adding the following path parameter:

- `payment_identifier`: The unique identifier of the payment to be voided.

Below you find an example request to void a payment:

```sh
curl --request POST \
--url https://testapi.linksmerchantservices.com/api/payments/<payment_identifier>/void \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <your_base64_encoded_credentials>'
```
