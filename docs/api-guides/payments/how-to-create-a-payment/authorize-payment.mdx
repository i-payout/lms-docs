LINKs API Authorize Payment endpoint can be used in a few different ways. It allows you to set the payment method, along with the needed data for the selected method. You can also define a `auto-capture` flag, allowing you to automatically capture the payment, skipping the need to make a call to the capture endpoint. This page presents you the different possibilities and parameters you can add to the authorization request.

```json
{
  "paymentMethodType": "CreditCard",
  "autoCapture": true
  // ... other fields
}
```
