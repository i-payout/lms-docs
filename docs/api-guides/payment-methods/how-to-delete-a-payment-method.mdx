On this page, you will find a walk-through guide on deleting a payment method and the necessary information to accomplish this task.

## Prerequisites

Before making any call to the LINKs API, you first need a merchant account. Contact our team at Discover@LinksMerchantServices.com to get started.

## Deleting a Payment Method

To delete a payment method in LINKs, you need to call the [Delete a Payment Method endpoint](/reference/links/delete-payment-method/). The following is the required parameter:

| **Parameter**               | **Description**                                           | **Required** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `paymentMethodIdentifier`   | The unique identifier of the payment method to delete.    | Yes          |

You can use the code snippet below to make the endpoint call with the required parameter:

```sh
curl --request POST \
--url 'https://testapi.linksmerchantservices.com/api/paymentmethod/delete/<PAYMENT_METHOD_IDENTIFIER>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <your_base64_encoded_credentials>'
```

<Callout type="info" title="Authentication">
  Depending on the request, LINKs API offers two forms of authentication,
  `Basic` and `client token`. Refer to the [Authentication](/authentication)
  guide to learn more about it.
</Callout>

This will result in a JSON response exemplified below:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "resultType": "Success",
    "merchantMessage": "Payment method deleted successfully.",
    "logIdentifier": "xyz12345",
    "logAsError": false
  },
  "merchantIdentifier": "<your_merchant_id>",
  "customerIdentifier": "<customer_id>",
  "customerReference": "<customer_reference>",
  "paymentMethodIdentifier": "<payment_method_id>"
}
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Irreversible Action">
  Deleting a payment method is an irreversible action. Ensure that you really want to delete the payment method before proceeding.
</Callout>
