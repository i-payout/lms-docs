When integrating LINKs, choosing the method that best fits your business needs is vital. This page summarizes the available integration methods and provides a comparison table to help you make an informed decision.

## Integrations Comparison

LINKs provides two types of integrations. In the following table, you can see all the details for each:

|                        | API Integration                                 | LINKs UI                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Interaction**   | No interaction with LINKs                       | Embedded on merchant site                                         |
| **Responsibility**     | Merchant                                        | LINKs                                                             |
| **Customization**      | High                                            | Medium                                                            |
| **Integration Effort** | High                                            | Medium                                                            |
| **Best For**           | Large businesses                                | Businesses needing some customization                             |
| **Main Goal**          | Complete control over user experience           | Integrating specific functionalities with pre-built UI components |
| **Example**            | E-commerce platform integrating credit card payment services | Seamless bank account setup on merchant website      |

## API Integration

API integration allows users to interact exclusively through the merchant's own interface, without needing to visit the LINKs platform. In this model, merchants are responsible for the front-end development and use LINKs APIs to handle back-end processes. This approach offers a high level of customization, enabling merchants to design their user experience precisely and integrate LINKs functionalities seamlessly. However, implementing all features via API requires significant integration effort and substantial development work.

This method is ideal for large businesses with strong technical teams capable of managing extensive integrations. It's particularly beneficial when companies need complete control over the user experience and want to incorporate payment functionalities, such as processing credit card transactions, into their existing systems. For example, an enterprise that wants to add credit card payment services to its e-commerce platform without redirecting users to an external site would find this approach advantageous.

## LINKs UI

With LINKs UI integration, users engage with LINKs functionalities embedded directly within the your website. The responsibility is shared. Merchants handle the front-end aspects while utilizing LINKs's pre-built UI components for specific tasks. This integration offers a medium level of customization, allowing merchants to incorporate particular functionalities without extensive development efforts. It requires a moderate level of integration, involving the embedding of scripts and minimal API interaction.

This solution is best suited for businesses that desire some level of customization but want to avoid handling sensitive information directly. It's ideal when companies wish to integrate specific functionalities—such as credit card payment processing or customer authentication—using pre-built UI components to ensure security and compliance. For instance, a merchant aiming to provide a seamless credit card payment experience on their website without building the UI from the ground up would benefit from this integration.
